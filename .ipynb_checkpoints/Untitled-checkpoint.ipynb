    "\n",
    "Affine neural networks usually don't scale very well to full images. Although, in the case of CIFAR dataset, images are size of 32x32x3 (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a single fully connected layer would have 32*32*3 = 3072 weights which can handle easily but this structure is not manageable for large images with many layers, e.g. 200x200x3, would lead neurons that have 200*200*3 = 120,000 weights. Thus, the number of parameters grows very fast which can be led to overfitting problem. Also, another advantage of convolutional neural network is that it takes advantage of image classification because it can consider edges and information about the location of a pixel because the neurons in a layer will only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. CNN capacity can be controlled by varying their depth and breadth, and they also make strong and mostly correct assumptions about the nature of images (namely, stationarity of statistics and locality of pixel dependencies). In addition, convolutional neural network has a big advantage over affine layers in terms of regularization."
